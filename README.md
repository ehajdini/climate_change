# climate_change
This project contains a jupyter notebook file and a .png image showing the temperature development of 4 cities. <br>
The jupyter notebook is chosen because everything is contained in one file including vizualizations, explanations, graphs and the trained models. It was comfortable to work with jupyter notebook rather than creating separate python scripts for each of the tasks. 
In order to test it locally you need to install Anaconda, download the dataset from kaggle, and install the following packages: pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow.

The model used to make predictions is a LSTM sequential model.
Answers to the questions of Predictive Modeling section can be found within the notebook.
